        <p><strong>On this bonus page!</strong> <br> This bonus page contains some things about me that aren't very important, but that people like to know about me! Below you can find an ordered list of my favourite to least favourite Ghibli movies. And you can find 5 new songs I have in my playlist. In the last year I have started watching a lot of movies. I even collect physical movies now so I can have the ones I love forever! I also really love music... I mean who doesn't. (You need something to do in the car)
