        <p>My name is Brooke Hynes. I'm currently living in Spryfield, Halifax, and have grown up in Spryfield my whole life. I have a cat named Mocha, and I used to have a dog named Maggie. I decided to apply for the graphic design program while I was studying Psychology at Saint Mary's University because I wanted to do something i was more interested in. </p>
