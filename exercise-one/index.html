        <p>My name is Brooke Hynes. I'm currently living in Spryfield, Halifax, and have grown up in Spryfield my whole life. I have a cat named Mocha, who is the sweetest little black cat. I decided to apply for the graphic design program while I was studying Psychology at Saint Mary's University because I wanted to do something I was more interested in. At the time I was also working on beginner design and social media for my family's business. After the graphic design program I am currently most interested in the web design side of the field. </p>
